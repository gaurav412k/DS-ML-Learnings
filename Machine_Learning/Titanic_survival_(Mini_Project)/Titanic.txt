Titanic_data Analysis

1. Import the necessary libraries for data analysis, such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and scikit-learn.

2. Load the Titanic dataset into your Python environment using Pandas.

3. Check the information about the dataset using the `info()` method and examine null values using the `isnull()` function. Also, utilize the `describe()` method to get a statistical summary of the data.

4. Analyze the numerical columns by creating a correlation matrix using the `.corr()` method and visualize it using a heatmap with Seaborn.

5. Analyze the 'SibSp' column using Seaborn's `catplot` to understand its distribution and relationship with other variables.

6. Analyze the 'Age' column using Seaborn's `FacetGrid` to visualize its distribution and how it correlates with survival.

7. Analyze the 'Sex' parameter by creating a bar graph to visualize the survival probability of different genders.

8. Analyze the 'Embarked' parameter to understand its distribution, although it's considered not important for survival prediction.

9. Handle null values in the 'Age' column by generating random numbers within a specific range based on the mean and standard deviation. Fill null values in the 'Embarked' column with 'S'. Drop unnecessary columns that do not contribute to the analysis. Handle the 'Sex' column using the `map()` function to convert categorical values to numerical.

10. Split the dataset into features (X) and target (y), where X contains the independent variables and y contains the dependent variable ('Survived').

11. Scale the features using appropriate scaling techniques like Min-Max scaling or Standardization.

12. Apply various classification algorithms such as Random Forest Classifier, Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Tree Classifier, etc., to train the model.

13. Evaluate the accuracy of each model using the `accuracy_score` function from scikit-learn by comparing the predicted values with the actual values of the target variable. This step helps in determining which classification algorithm performs best for predicting survival on the Titanic dataset.
